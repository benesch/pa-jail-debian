Peteramati
==========

Peteramati is a Web system for collecting, evaluating, and grading student
programming assignments. Peter Amati collects student assignments using Git.
It uses Linux jails to run student assignments; assignment code is segregated
from the main machine. Students can run test code themselves.

Configuration
-------------

Peteramati is configured primarily through the `psets.json` file. See
[doc/psetsjson.md](doc/psetsjson.md) for more information.
